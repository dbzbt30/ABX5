id: cellulitis
name: Cellulitis, Erysipelas or Skin Abscess
category: skin
description: Infection of the skin and soft tissue, ranging from superficial to deep involvement
tags: [acute, skin]

epidemiology:
  commonPathogens:
    - Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep)
    - Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)
    - Other beta-hemolytic streptococci

diagnosticPearls:
  - Assess for purulence (abscess, furuncle, carbuncle)
  - Mark and measure area of erythema to track progression
  - Consider blood cultures in severe cases
  - Evaluate for deeper infection or necrotizing process
  - Document severity assessment

  Follow the clinical pathway: Nonpurulent infections target streptococci; purulent infections require MRSA coverage. Incision and drainage is primary for abscesses. Stepdown to oral therapy when clinically improving. See stepdown guidance for details.

  wound_care:
    - "Keep wound dressing clean and dry"
    - "Change dressing as instructed"
    - "Watch for signs of wound reopening"
    - "Complete all antibiotics even if wound looks better"
  followUp:
    scheduling:
      - "Schedule follow-up in 2-3 days for severe cases or if not improving"
