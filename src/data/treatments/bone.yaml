empiricLogic: For acute osteomyelitis, cover Staphylococcus aureus with cefazolin or cloxacillin IV. For diabetic foot osteomyelitis, broader coverage including gram-negatives and anaerobes is often needed. Septic arthritis requires urgent joint washout and IV antibiotics targeting S. aureus.
treatments:
  - conditionId: osteomyelitis
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Obtain bone cultures when possible before starting antibiotics
      - Prolonged therapy (4-6 weeks) typically required
      - Consider surgical debridement for chronic osteomyelitis
  - conditionId: septic-arthritis
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Surgical drainage or arthroscopic washout often necessary
      - Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen
      - Gonococcal arthritis should be considered in sexually active young adults
  - conditionId: prosthetic-joint
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Requires multidisciplinary approach with orthopedics and infectious diseases
      - Biofilm-active antibiotics often needed
      - May require implant removal or debridement with implant retention (DAIR)
