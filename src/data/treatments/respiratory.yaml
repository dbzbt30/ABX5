empiricLogic: For community-acquired pneumonia in a previously healthy adult, first-line is high-dose amoxicillin (to cover pneumococcus); add a macrolide (azithromycin) or use doxycycline to cover atypicals if needed. Comorbid patients or inpatient CAP require β-lactam + macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (reserved for beta-lactam allergy or second-line).
treatments:
  - conditionId: pneumonia-cap
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Duration is typically 5 days if clinically stable
      - Reserve fluoroquinolones as last-line therapy
      - Consider severity assessment using CURB-65 or PSI
  - conditionId: pneumonia-hap
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Consider local antibiogram for empiric therapy
      - Assess risk for multidrug-resistant organisms
      - De-escalate therapy based on culture results
  - conditionId: pneumonia-aspiration
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Cover oral anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate or clindamycin)
      - Consider risk factors for resistant organisms
  - conditionId: resp-pharyngitis
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Confirm with rapid strep test or throat culture when possible
      - Penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days is first-line
      - Macrolides if penicillin-allergic
  - conditionId: resp-sinusitis
    firstLine: []
    notes:
      - Most cases are viral and do not require antibiotics
      - Consider antibiotics if symptoms >10 days, severe symptoms, or worsening pattern
  - conditionId: resp-otitis
    firstLine: []
